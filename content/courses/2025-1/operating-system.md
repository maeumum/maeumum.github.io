## Core Learning Topics

* **Process & Thread Management:** Understanding process lifecycle, context switching, and the benefits of multi-threading.
* **CPU Scheduling:** Analysis of various scheduling algorithms (FCFS, SJF, Priority, Round Robin) and their impact on system throughput.
* **Memory Management:** In-depth study of **Paging**, **Segmentation**, and the implementation of **Virtual Memory**.
* **Concurrency Control:** Solutions to synchronization problems (e.g., Semaphores, Monitors) and the Deadlock problem.

## Key Achievements

* **Scheduling Simulation:** Created simulations (in C/C++) to compare the performance metrics (e.g., waiting time, turnaround time) of different CPU scheduling policies.
* **System Understanding:** Gained critical insight into the complex mechanisms that manage hardware resources, preparing me for low-level system programming.

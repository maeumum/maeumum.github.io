## Core Learning Topics

* **Algorithm Analysis:** Understanding Time and Space Complexity ($O()$ notation) for algorithm efficiency evaluation.
* **Design Paradigms:** Mastering key techniques like Divide and Conquer, Greedy Algorithms, and Dynamic Programming.
* **Data Structures for Algorithms:** Practical application of advanced data structures such as Heaps, Hash Tables, and Graphs in problem-solving.

## Key Achievements

* I implemented various sorting and searching algorithms directly in Python and compared their performance.
* By utilizing online blocking systems such as Baekjun, i focus on solving graph search (BFS/DFS) problems and improve problem-solving ability.

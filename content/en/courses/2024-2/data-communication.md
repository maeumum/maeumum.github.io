## Core Learning Topics

* **OSI & TCP/IP Models:** Deep understanding of the 7-layer OSI model and the 4-layer TCP/IP stack, focusing on the roles of each layer.
* **Key Protocols:** Detailed study of crucial protocols like TCP (reliability, flow control, congestion control) and IP (addressing, routing).
* **Physical Layer:** Fundamentals of signal transmission, encoding, and multiplexing techniques.

## Key Achievements

* **Learning the basics of Socket Programming**, I have demonstrated the concept of the data link layer and the transport layer on a hands-on basis.
* Understanding the network error detection and recovery mechanisms realized the importance of designing stable communication systems..

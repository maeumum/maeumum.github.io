## Core Learning Topics

* **Probability Theory:** Concepts of conditional probability, Bayes' theorem, and random variables.
* **Distributions:** Study of major probability distributions (Binomial, Normal, Poisson) and their applications in data modeling.
* **Statistical Inference:** Principles of hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and regression analysis basics.

## Key Achievements


* Understanding that machine learning algorithms (e.g., Naive Bayes classifier) are based on statistical principles, we have laid the mathematical foundation for learning in the field of AI.

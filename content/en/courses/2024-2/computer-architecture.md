Core Learning Topics

* **CPU Design:** Detailed understanding of the data path, control unit, and instruction cycle.
* **Memory Hierarchy:** Principles of cache memory, virtual memory, and their impact on system performance.
* **Pipelining & Parallelism:** Concepts of instruction-level parallelism (ILP) and techniques like pipelining to increase CPU throughput.

## Key Achievements

* I analyzed **simple instruction set structure (ISA)**, such as MIPS or RISC-V, and understood how each instruction runs inside the CPU.
* The connection between operating systems and memory management has given me a deeper understanding of how to optimize software from a hardware perspective.

Through this course, I have a clear picture of how the code written by the programmer actually runs on the hardware, which broadens my system optimization vision.

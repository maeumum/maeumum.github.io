## Core Learning Topics

* **Network Architecture:** Advanced study of the Internet Protocol (IP) and Transport Layer Protocols (TCP/UDP) functionalities.
* **Routing & Addressing:** Detailed examination of IP addressing (Subnetting, CIDR) and popular routing algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra's, Link-State).
* **Application Layer:** Protocols and functions of HTTP, DNS, and Email systems.

## Key Achievements

* **Packet Analysis:** Used **Wireshark** to capture and analyze network traffic, confirming the function of various protocols (ARP, DHCP, TCP handshake).
* **Socket Programming Project:** Developed a simple network application (e.g., a file transfer utility) using Python sockets to demonstrate end-to-end communication.

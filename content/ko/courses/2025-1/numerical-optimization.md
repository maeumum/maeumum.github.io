## Core Learning Topics

* **Root Finding:** Algorithms for finding roots of non-linear equations, such as Newton's Method.
* **Optimization Algorithms:** Principles of unconstrained optimization, focusing on **Gradient Descent** and its variants (essential for deep learning).
* **Numerical Methods:** Techniques for numerical differentiation, integration, and solving systems of linear equations (e.g., Gaussian Elimination).

## Key Achievements

* **Algorithm Implementation:** Implemented the Gradient Descent algorithm in Python/MATLAB to find the minimum of a simple cost function.
* **Mathematical Foundation:** Gained a solid mathematical and algorithmic basis necessary to understand complex machine learning model training processes.

ðŸ‘‹ This page documents my academic progress for the **3rd Year, 1st Semester**.

This semester focused on specializing in core computer science fields, led by **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**. I concentrated on deepening my expertise by tackling subjects like **Operating System (OS)** and **Database (DB)**. Furthermore, **Computer Network** and **Numerical Analysis & Optimization** reinforced the theoretical foundation for system design and data analysis.

## Core Learning Topics

* **Relational Model:** Deep understanding of relational algebra, functional dependencies, and normalization (up to 3NF).
* **SQL Mastery:** Advanced use of Data Manipulation Language (DML) and Data Definition Language (DDL) for complex queries and schema creation.
* **Transaction Management:** Principles of ACID properties, concurrency control (e.g., locking), and recovery mechanisms.

## Key Achievements

* **Schema Design:** Successfully designed and implemented a normalized relational database schema for a practical scenario (e.g., university administration or e-commerce).
* **Advanced Queries:** Proficiently wrote complex SQL queries utilizing subqueries, joins, and views.

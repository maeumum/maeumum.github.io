## Core Learning Topics

* **Logic Gates & Boolean Algebra:** Fundamental concepts of AND, OR, NOT, XOR gates and simplification using Karnaugh maps.
* **Combinational Circuits:** Design and analysis of circuits like Adders, Multiplexers, and Decoders.
* **Sequential Circuits:** Principles of Latches, Flip-flops (D, JK, T), and basic Register design.

## Key Achievements

Designed and simulated a simple digital circuit (e.g., 4-bit adder) using a hardware description language (HDL) or simulation tools.
